bitwise tricks
5%10--> a&(2**y-1)

power 2**y=2<<y-1

swaping two numbers
x=x^y
y=x^y
x=x^y

property

no of set bits in A =x
no of set bits in B=y
no of set bits in (a^b)=z
then
z is even if x+y is even 
z is odd if x+y is odd

second property

a+b=(a^b)+2(a&b)
a+b=(a|b)+(a&b)

(total + x - 1) // x =>it is used to find the ceil value trick
